## 1. `glimpse()` Function

The `glimpse()` function from the `dplyr` package in R provides a quick overview of a data frame or tibble. Unlike `head()`, which shows only the first few rows, `glimpse()` displays the data structure along with the column names, types, and the first few entries of each column. This is useful for quickly inspecting large datasets without overwhelming the console.

```{r}
# Example of using the glimpse function
library(dplyr)
glimpse(data)
```

Testing! You forgot to close the last code block with ```. See above :)
